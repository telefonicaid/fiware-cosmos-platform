        <h3>What is Cosmos?</h3>
        <p>Cosmos is an on-demand, big data platform for internal Telef&oacute;nica consumption.
            You can create and destroy Hadoop clusters to perform computations and store your data
            in Infinity, our persistent storage solution.</p>

        <h3>What services do Cosmos clusters support?</h3>
        <p>All clusters contain HDFS and MapReduce pre-installed. You are able to choose extra
            services when creating the cluster. We currently support Hive, Pig, Oozie and Sqoop as
            additional services.</p>

        <h3>There is a product in the Hadoop ecosystem which isn't supported by Cosmos. What can I
            do?</h3>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:cosmos@@tid.es">cosmos@@tid.es</a>! We are happy to add our
            user's requests to our backlog and we strive to provide a quick turnaround.</p>

        <h3>I am trying to create a cluster but it keeps telling me there are no resources
            left!</h3>
        <p>Cosmos is a service in high demand, so it is not uncommon for all our machines to be in
            use. Since our first release we have more than doubled the compute capacity of the
            platform and we keep adding more machines as our budget lets us.</p>

        <h3>I would like to guarantee a certain number of machines for my team. Is that
            possible?</h3>
        <p>Sure! You can buy machines for our pool and we will guarantee your team a minimum amount
        of compute power.</p>

        <h3>Is Cosmos a secure environment?</h3>
        <p>Access to data stored in Infinity is authenticated and authorized through file permissions.
            Compute clusters are not secured at the network level, so any open ports might be accessed
            by other users in the network.</p>

        <h3>Does this mean my data is not private?</h3>
        <p>Data stored in Infinity is private and secure. Data stored in a Cosmos cluster might be accessed by anyone
            who can access the Cosmos frontend page.</p>

        <h3>When I try to download or use Cosmos CLI I am getting an SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE
            error. Why and what can I do?</h3>

        <p>As of v0.13, Cosmos supports Secure HTTP (https) via SSL using certificates provided by
            @config.getString("ssl.authority"). This means that you can no longer access Cosmos via
            simple HTTP.</p>
        <p>In order to securely communicate with Cosmos your machine needs to trust the Cosmos
            server.
            To do that, it needs be told to trust the certificates on which Cosmos' secure
            communication is based.</p>

        <p>What you need to do is install the CA and ROOT certificates found in
            <a href="@config.getString("ssl.certificateLocation")">
            @config.getString("ssl.certificateLocation")</a>. For more information please contact
            <a href="mailto:@config.getString("ssl.support.email")">
            @config.getString("ssl.support.name")</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Note:</i> secure communication with the Cosmos server does not mean that Cosmos
            Hadoop clusters are secure. Please see related question above for more information.</p>
