        <h3>What is Cosmos?</h3>
        <p>Cosmos is an on-demand, big data platform for internal Telef&oacute;nica consumption.
            You can create and destroy Hadoop clusters to perform computations and store your data
            in Infinity, our persistent storage solution.</p>

        <h3>What services do Cosmos clusters support?</h3>
        <p>All clusters contain HDFS and MapReduce pre-installed. You are able to choose extra
            services when creating the cluster. We currently support Hive, Pig, Oozie and Sqoop as
            additional services.</p>

        <h3>There is a product in the Hadoop ecosystem which isn't supported by Cosmos. What can I
            do?</h3>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:cosmos@@tid.es">cosmos@@tid.es</a>! We are happy to add our
            user's requests to our backlog and we strive to provide a quick turnaround.</p>

        <h3>I am trying to create a cluster but it keeps telling me there are no resources
            left!</h3>
        <p>Cosmos is a service in high demand, so it is not uncommon for all our machines to be in
            use. Since our first release we have more than doubled the compute capacity of the
            platform and we keep adding more machines as our budget lets us.</p>

        <h3>I would like to guarantee a certain number of machines for my team. Is that
            possible?</h3>
        <p>Sure! You can buy machines for our pool and we will guarantee your team a minimum amount
        of compute power.</p>

        <h3>Is Cosmos a secure environment?</h3>
        <p>No. Hadoop is an insecure by default product and Cosmos currently does not provide the
            extra layer of security Hadoop requires.</p>

        <h3>Does this mean my data is not private?</h3>
        <p>Correct. Data stored either in a Cosmos cluster or in Infinity can be accessed by anyone
            who can access the Cosmos frontend page.</p>

        <h3>Are there any plans to add access security to the platform?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We are evaluating different options to add this feature to the platform.</p>

        <h3>I've been added to a colleague's cluster but <tt>cosmos ssh</tt> doesn't let me in.</h3>
        <p>This is a known bug to be fixed on the next release. Meanwhile ask the cluster owner
            for the master node (available by running <tt>cosmos show [cluster-id]</tt>) and use the
            ssh command by yourself.</p>
