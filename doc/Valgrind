USAGE:
  valgrind --tool=$Tool  executable options

  Tool:
    o Memcheck (default) - memory error detector                - repotr memory leaks
    o Cachegrind         - cache and branch-prediction profiler - makes your programs run faster
    o Callgrind          - call-graph generating cache profiler - 
    o Helgrind           - thread error detector                - corrects multi-threaded programs
    o DRD                - another thread error detector        - finds different errors than Helgrind
    o Massif             - heap profiler                        - helps to use less memory
    o DHAT               - another heap profiler                - 
    o Ptrcheck           - experimental heap, stack and global array overrun detector


  Valgrind options
    o --track-fds=yes           - print out a list of open file descriptors on exit. Along with each file descriptor 
                                  is printed a stack backtrace of where the file was opened and any details relating 
                                  to the file descriptor such as the file name or socket details.
    o --trace-children=yes      - trace into sub-processes initiated via the exec system call.

    o --trace-children-skip=pat - works only when --trace-children=yes is specified. It allows for some children to be skipped.
                                  The option takes a comma separated list of patterns for the names of child executables that
                                  Valgrind should not trace into.
                                  Patterns may include the metacharacters ? and *, which have the usual meaning.

    o --gen-suppressions=yes    - print suppression for errors (as to avoid uninteresting errors) 
                                  The output should be copied into a 'suppressions' file.    

  Compilation
    o The executable (and its libraries) should be compiled with the '-g' option in order for valgrind to work ultimately.
      Without debugging info, the best Valgrind tools will be able to do is guess which function a particular piece of code
      belongs to andthis is not what you want ...

    o Also, it is interesting to avoid using 'inline' functions - use the g++ option '-fno-inline' 

    o Optimization confuses 'Memcheck', so the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether - use the '-O' flag as is. 

    o You should compile your code with -Wall because it can identify some or all of the problems that Valgrind can miss
      at the higher optimisation levels.



EXAMPLE USAGE
  % valgrind -v  --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --show-reachable=yes  samsonLocal  2> valgrind.out.03
  % valgrind -v  --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --show-reachable=yes  --trace-children=yes --trace-children-skip=samsonWorker samsonSpawner -fg  2> valgrind.out.01


PERFORMANCE ISSUES
  Valgrind takes control of your program before it starts, makes the program run on a synthetic CPU provided by the Valgrind core.
  'Memcheck' checks every memory access and every value computed, making it run 10-50 times slower than natively.
  The minimal tool, called Nulgrind, adds no instrumentation at all and causes in total "only" about a 4 times slowdown.


  
INVOCATION
  You should run the real (machine-code) executable here. If use're using a script to start the executable, please either prepare-
  the shell with the stuff prepared in the script, or edit the script so valgrind is used to invoke the executable.



VALGRIND CONSOLE OUTPUT
  Valgrind tools write a commentary, a stream of text, detailing error reports and other significant events.
  All lines in the commentary have following form:

    ==12345== some-message-from-Valgrind

  The '12345' is the PID of the process.

  For a more verbose execution, pass the option '-v' to valgrind.
  A second -v gives yet more detail.


  By default, the output is written to stderr.
  If you want to send it to some other file descriptor, for example number 9, you can specify --log-fd=9.
  A better option is to write the commentary to a file, which you specify by --log-file=filename.

  You can also ask valgrind to send the output to a network socket, e.g.:  --log-socket=10.95.105.227:1239
  The default port is 1500.
  There is a simple listener executable, 'valgrind-listener' that reads from the socket and prints the incoming messages
  on stdout.

  valgrind-listener options:
    o --exit-at-zero:    when the number of connected processes falls back to zero, exit.
    o portnumber: changes the port it listens on (1024 - 65535)

  If no server is accepting connections, valgrind switches back to writing the commentary to stderr.



ERROR REPORTING
  An example from Memcheck:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ==25832== Invalid read of size 4
  ==25832==    at 0x8048724: BandMatrix::ReSize(int, int, int) (bogon.cpp:45)
  ==25832==    by 0x80487AF: main (bogon.cpp:66)
  ==25832==  Address 0xBFFFF74C is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Meaning:
    The program did an illegal 4-byte read of address 0xBFFFF74C, which is not a valid stack address, nor corresponds
    to any current heap blocks or recently freed heap blocks. The read is happening at line 45 of bogon.cpp,
    called from line 66 of the same file, etc. 


    Identical errors are stacked and reported only once.
    If you want to know how many times each error occurred, run with the -v option.
    When execution finishes, all the reports are printed out, along with, and sorted by, their occurrence counts.
    This makes it easy to see which errors have occurred most frequently.

    In general, you should try and fix errors in the order that they are reported, some errors depend on a previous error and
    will disappear when the first error is fixed.

    Valgrind stops collecting errors after 1,000 different errors have been seen, or 10,000,000 errors in total have been seen.
    To avoid this cutoff you can use the --error-limit=no.



SUPPRESSING ERRORS
    The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the system libraries, such as the C library, and as you can't do much 
    about these errors, its normally better to just turn them off.
    Valgrind reads a list of errors to suppress at startup. A default suppression file is created by the ./configure script
    when the system is built.

    By default, Valgrind uses $PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp.
    You can ask to add suppressions from another file, by specifying --suppressions=<path to suppression file>.
    The easiest way to add suppressions is to use the --gen-suppressions=yes option and edit the suppressions file using the
    knowledge of the suppression names.

    Suppression file format
      A file can contain various suppressions, each inside a {} block
      Each valgrind subcommand (e.g. memcheck) can have different suppressions in the suppression file. So the suppression line
      contains the name of the tool to use it.
      The first line of a suppression block is a user-defined name of the suppression.
      The second line contains the filter (that tells valgrind what tool should use it) and the real name of the suppression.
      These 'real' suppression names are found in the output of a valgrind execution with the '--gen-suppressions=yes' option and '-v'

      Example of a suppression file with two suppressions:
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      {
        HackCond
        Memcheck,Cachegrind:dl-hack3-cond-1
      }

      {
        AnotherSuppression
        Memcheck:Param
      }
      -----------------------------------------------------------

      Now, we have a suppression file and we can start the execution using it by:
      % valgrind --suppressions=<suppression file path> <executable> <options for executable>

      After the first two lines in a suppression block comes the calling context for the error -
      the chain of function calls that led to it.
      This is how valgrind detects that two similar errors aren't identical.
      The option '--gen-suppressions=yes' gives all the information about the errors, just copy and paste the valgrind
      output suppression block into your suppression file to get 'rid of it'.

      IMPORTANT NOTE: C++ function names must be mangled. If you are writing suppressions by hand, use the --demangle=no option 
      to get the mangled names in your error messages. An example of a mangled C++ name is _ZN9QListView4showEv.
      This is the form that the GNU C++ compiler uses internally, and the form that must be used in suppression files.
      The equivalent demangled name, QListView::show(), is what you see at the C++ source code level.



CONFIGURATION FILES

  To run a simple valgrind test with samsonWorker, create the following files in your home directory:

  * ~/.valgrindrc
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -v
  --leak-check=full
  --track-origins=yes
  --suppressions=/home/XXX/Valgrind/warning-suppression   # Change 'XXX' ...
  --show-reachable=yes
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  * Valgrind/warning-suppression
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  {
     <first_dlopen>
